\section{Checkpoint: Traces and level curves }
Consider the functions $C(x,y) = 2x^2 +y^2$ and $S(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. (Notice that $S$ is, like, a 4-dimensional function -- three inputs and one output.)

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Write equations and sketch graphs for the $y=-2$, $y=0$, and $y=2$ traces of $C$.
    \item Write equations and sketch graphs for the $x=-2$, $x=0$, and $x=2$ traces of $C$.
    \item What can you say about the general shape of $x$-traces of this function? How about $y$-traces? How are they similar and how are they different?

\hrulefill
    \item Write equations and sketch graphs for the level curves of $C$ at 0, 2, and 4.
    \item What can you say about the general shape of the contours of this function?
    \item Why didn't I ask about contours at -2 or -4?

\hrulefill
    \item Write an equation for the contour of $S$ at 1.
    \item What's this equation? \\
    (Hint: you can graph it in CalcPlot3D if you use the ``implicit surface'' option.)
    \item Maybe now I can't call this a ``level curve'' but instead I should call it a ``level surface.'' Why?
\end{enumerate}
